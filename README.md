# Password-Generator

## Description

My motivation was to create a password generator with a specific amount of requirements so that it could be considered "strong". I built this project so it could help individuals in need of a strong password. This problem solves several security issues, such as having a password that could easily be guessed. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with randomizing characters.
